# aurum
A very simple AUR installer.

### Usage

To download and install a AUR package you need to find it's name. You can use the 
[AUR Package Search](https://aur.archlinux.org/) for this task. When you have the 
`package_name` you can start using aurum!

```
./aurum.sh package_name
```

Have fun!
